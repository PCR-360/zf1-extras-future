Post end of life changes for zf1 to allow compatibility with the latest PHP versions.

Support here is minimal, most of the focus is on the main zf1 future repo. If you find an issue or want something improved, feel free to bring it up in an issue or even better, make a PR. If you have any requests for tags, releases, or anything else, then raise an issue and I'll get it sorted.

Installable through git clone or through `composer require shardj/zf1-extras-future` https://packagist.org/packages/shardj/zf1-extras-future
